    "- A geoprocessing package portal item does not let you run the tool on the server, it only lets you use the portal's security and sharing model to control who can download the package to their local machine."

    "- Should a geoprocessing tool be used in the script, the user must be able to license that tool. Read [this help doc](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/geoprocessing_and_python/accessing-licenses-and-extensions-in-python.htm) for more.\n",
    "- The end user must have any python packages used by the script tool installed. \n",
    "- Arcpy tools can  honor geoprocessing environment settings. If you hard code environment settings in your script, consider if that is helping or hurting the user. Read [this help doc](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/geoprocessing_and_python/using-environment-settings.htm) for more details."
